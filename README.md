Tigress Protection
==================

Another partial solution to the Tigress protection challenges, inspired by the work done
by Jonathan Salwan and Quarkslab, [here][Quarkslab]. Whereas Quarkslab's solution relies
on Triton, ours is implemented via angr and llvmlite.

Samples and challenges are taken directly from the [aforementioned][Quarkslab] repository
as well.
